title: Topics for mixed-model workshop
---

## Basics

- Overview, philosophical issues
   - Definition of random vs fixed
   - Experimental design: within- vs between-subject, nested vs crossed, random-slopes models. Model specification; equations and formulas
   - Picking a model: how to control model complexity
- Exploratory data visualization
   - `ggplot2` for (moderately) high-dimensional data
- Basic model definitions: LMMs and simple GLMMs
- Basic model fitting (`lme4`)
- Model diagnostics
- Basic inference (hypothesis testing and confidence intervals)
- Graphical and textual presentation of results
   
## Intermediate

- Troubleshooting
    - Convergence errors
	- Overfitted models

	- Zero-inflation
- Predictions and predicted CIs
- Intermediate graphics
    - Prediction plots
- Multivariate responses

## Advanced

- Temporal and spatial correlation
- Ordinal models
- Bayesian/MCMC approaches
- Power analysis
